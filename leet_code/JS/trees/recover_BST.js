// The idea is simple, find the two nodes that are swapped by mistake and 
// then swap back their values.The question is how to find out those two nodes ?
//     As we know, an inorder traversal of BST gives us a sorted array, 
// if two elements in the array are swapped, we can find them out in one scan, 
// that is whenever we see the previous value is larger than the current value, we can mark them.

// For example, let's say we have a sorted array [0, 1] and we swap the values,
//  so that array becomes [1, 0], when we scan through, we found that 1 > 0, 
// we know that 1 and 0 are the nodes that are swapped by mistake.

// Take another example, in this array[0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3], 3 and 5 are swapped 
// by mistake, when we scan the array, we noticed that 5 > 4 and 4 > 3. How to 
// get 3 and 5 ? Whenever we find a mistake, if it's the first one, mark both 
// nodes as "first" and "second", for the second mistake, we just have to update 
// the "second", see the codes below.

// But we are not there yet, the question asks us to use constant space, so 
// we can't store the values of the BST in an array, that will be O(n) space 
// complexity. The solution is to use DFS and traverse the tree in inorder manner.

// So time complexity is O(n), space complexity is O(1)(if we don't care about 
// recursion stack, otherwise it's the height of the tree).
